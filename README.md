This repository is the creation of a web page from scratch. 

My objective is to demonstrate understanding of basic HTML structures and 
concepts in conjunction with CSS. I will be focus on correctly structuring an
HTML document with appropriate classes and ID's in order to style them with 
CSS and use Flexbox in order to style the page accurately and place my objects 
in desired locations.
